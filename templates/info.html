                     Project Portal is collection of various projects done by me.I have learnt Data Analysis,Machine learning and various things related to Data Science. I have done projects related to this topics.The main idea behind creating this portal is to have all projects from different fields in one single application!

                 <p>
                     It is collection of different kinds of projects and applications created by me.It consists of projects from various fields like Data Analysis , Machine Learning , Power Bi and many to come!I have done projects in various domains like health care,sports,automobile,sales and many more.Please feel free to explore the projects!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 Here I have created 25+ Data Science projects and application from various domains like Agricultural, Sports, fitness, Medical and many more.I have used several datasets from Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning repository for building these projects.The created machine learning applications have been deployed on the cloud platform and the source code of the designed application is also  available and can be viewed in the Github!Please feel free to check variety of projects across all domains!Other than that the portal also consists of Data Analysis and Microsoft Power Bi Projects.
                 <h4>Data Analysis Projects :- </h4>

                 <p>
                     The process of analyzing the data and getting valuable insights from it in Graphical or Numerical Format by cleaning and applying statistical techniques is called Data Analysis.Data Analysis consists of various steps and to properly analyze the data these set of steps should be followed which will ultimately result in Valuable Insights.Data Understanding , Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Plotting graphs , performing Statistical Analysis like outlier detection are some of the most important steps involved in the Data Analysis Project or say Data Analysis Life Cycle.Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Sci-Py , Pandas-Profiling are used for performing Data Analysis. For plotting the data and creating Visualizations we can make use of Libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. All in all there are various libraries involved in building successful Data Analysis Life Cycle!

                     I have done Data Analysis Projects in various domains like Sports, Education, HealthCare, Technical, Civil, etc. Please navigate through View Projects button to view Data Analysis Projects.There inside we can see list of projects with appropriate links attached to it!

                     <h4>Machine Learning Projects :- </h4>
                 <p>
                     Machine Learning - One of the Hottest Technologies out there!It is nothing but ability/power given to the computers to explicitly learn things without human intervention.It is one of the trending technologies in world right now!I have created various Machine learning applications in various domains.Data Analysis is the first step to perform build Machine learning model and for data analysis we have discussed the things earlier in upper section.Moving forward for creating appropriate Machine Learning models or applications we need libraries like Sci-Kit Learn further after creating the model Hyper Parameter Tuning should be done by using standard procedure.Further for creating application the pickle file should be created and frontend should be developed further API should be created finally the application is to be deployed on the desired cloud platform.Further link is generated and to access the application the link generated should be used.The application is hosted on the cloud and every one can be able to access it!

                     <h4>Microsoft Power BI Projects :- </h4>
                 <p>
                     Microsoft Power BI is the in form Analytics tool in the world.The data here can be easily analyzed with the help of few clicks. The free Power Bi desktop version is also available and it provides more than enough functionalities that one can use. There are many analytics functions and methods that can be used for data analysis and data  cleaning without much effort. In case of Visuals there are 30+ freely available visuals and if one has microsoft account he has many options.The data is to be analyzed and visualizations are needed to be created for proper understanding.The visuals are interactive and can change based on situation and condition!
